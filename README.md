Android Push Notification with Firebase

The new Firebase, which the company announced at its I/O developer conference today, takes the service’s existing features 
and expands upon them. 
In its previous incarnation, Firebase was somewhat similar to Facebook’s now-defunct Parse in that it offered a database 
service, user authentication features and hosting tools. 
In this new version, 
Firebase takes many of Google’s existing developer tools, like Google Cloud Messaging, 
and combines them with new and existing Firebase services.
